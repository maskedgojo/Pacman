# Pac-Man Game in Java
==========================

## Introduction
------------

This project is a Java implementation of the classic arcade game Pac-Man. It uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate game logic, user interface, and control flow.

## Project Description
-------------------

The game includes core Pac-Man gameplay mechanics such as Pac-Man movement, ghost movement, collision detection, scoring, level progression, and power-ups. The user interface is designed to be visually appealing and interactive.

## Features
------------

- **MVC Architecture**: Separates game logic, UI, and control flow for maintainability.
- **Java Swing UI**: Provides a visually appealing and interactive game interface.
- **Game Logic**: Includes Pac-Man and ghost movement, collision detection, scoring, and power-ups.
- **Map Generation**: Allows for dynamic map creation with varying sizes.
